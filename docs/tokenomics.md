## Deflationary Mechanics (The Incinerator)

Flux implements a rigorous "buyback and burn" model:
- **30%** of all protocol fees (origination, liquidation, flash loans) are automatically routed to the **Flux Incinerator**.
- The Incinerator program aggregates these fees and performs a daily atomic burn.
- **Projected Deflation:** ~2.5% per annum based on current volume models.

- **Gauge Weight Voting**: Control where liquidity mining rewards are directed.
